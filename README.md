# Employee-Tracker
In the 12th week of the UCB Coding Bootcamp, students tackled a SQL and data table management project. With no starter code provided, they leveraged SQL and Inquirer to develop a user-customizable employee table creation tool. This hands-on challenge tested their SQL skills and ability to design an intuitive interface for data management.

## Usage 
To initiate the code, begin by executing it with Node.js. Upon running, you will be prompted to input information relevant to the companies you are overseeing. Start by establishing a department, followed by specifying a role or job title, along with its corresponding department affiliation. Proceed to input the required details. Once this is done, you can proceed to create a new employee and allocate them a job. The remaining information will be automatically integrated into the table.
